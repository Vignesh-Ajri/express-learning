# Express Routing

## Topics Covered

- What is Routing in Express
- Basic Routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Route Parameters (`req.params`)
- Query Strings (`req.query`)
- Modular Routing with Router

## Best Practices

- Keep routes in separate files
- Use meaningful names for parameters (`:userId` not just `:id`)
- Use query strings for optional filters
- Use middleware for common logic (auth, logging)
