# REST API Best Practices

#### Following best practices ensures your API is secure, scalable, maintainable, and easy for developers to use.

## Design and Structure

1.  **Statelessness**: Every request from a client must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not store any client context between requests. Use tokens (like JWT) for authentication instead of server-side sessions.

2.  **Use HTTPS Everywhere**: Encrypt all communication between the client and server to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. There is no reason to use non-secure HTTP.

3.  **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Stick to a single convention for URLs, JSON keys, and parameters. `camelCase` for JSON keys (`"firstName"`) and `kebab-case` for URLs (`/user-profiles`) are common choices.

4.  **Provide Meaningful HTTP Status Codes**: Use status codes to accurately reflect the outcome of a request.

    - **2xx (Success)**: `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content`
    - **3xx (Redirection)**: `301 Moved Permanently`
    - **4xx (Client Errors)**: `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`
    - **5xx (Server Errors)**: `500 Internal Server Error`, `503 Service Unavailable`

5.  **Clear and Consistent Error Messages**: When an error occurs, provide a useful JSON payload that developers can parse.
    ```
    {
      "status": 400,
      "error": "Validation Error",
      "message": "The 'email' field is required and must be a valid email address.",
      "path": "/users"
    }
    ```

## Functionality

6.  **Implement Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination**: For collection endpoints, these features are essential to prevent large data transfers and allow clients to get exactly what they need.

    - `GET /users?status=active&sort=lastName&page=1&limit=25`

7.  **Support Partial Responses (Field Selection)**: Allow clients to request only the fields they need to reduce payload size.

    - `GET /users/123?fields=id,name,email`

8.  **Versioning**: Make versioning mandatory from the start to manage changes without breaking client integrations. URL-based versioning is the most common approach.
    - `https://api.example.com/v1/users`
    - `https://api.example.com/v2/users`

## Security

9.  **Secure Authentication**: Use a standard, robust authentication mechanism like **OAuth 2.0** or **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. Do not reinvent the wheel.

10. **Implement Authorization (Permissions)**: Once a user is authenticated, ensure they are authorized to perform the requested action. For example, a user should only be able to edit their own profile, not someone else's.

11. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Protect your API from abuse (both intentional and accidental) by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a given time frame. Return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

12. **Validate Input**: Always validate incoming data on the server side to protect against malformed data and security vulnerabilities like SQL injection.

## Documentation

13. **Provide Comprehensive Documentation**: Good documentation is non-negotiable. Use a standard like the **OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger)** to describe your endpoints, parameters, request/response bodies, and authentication methods. This allows for auto-generated documentation, client SDKs, and testing tools.
